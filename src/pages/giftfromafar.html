              Gift from afar is one of my projects for the University course Bespoke Design. The
              purpose of this was to design a digital gift-giving experience for people living far
              away from friends and family tuned to the personality, interests, and needs of a
              specific user. This project was made in teams of two.

            Receiving personalized gifts from friends and family is not possible for students
            studying abroad.

            <h4>Research</h4>
            <p>
              During the first few weeks, I met with my user for the first time and came up with research questions, set-up, and techniques.  This was followed by conducting a semi-structured interview, shadowing my user, and having her make a collage that represents her. Afterward, I placed the information I gathered from the research on Miro to create clusters. These helped me gain important insights into my user and create a user portrait.

            <h4>Surprise for the User</h4>
            <p>
              During the Dutch traditional Sinterklass day, I had to make a 'surprise' for my user. Sinterklaas gifts are to be creatively disguised and are usually accompanied by a humorous poem that has something to do with the character or a characteristic of the receiver. I had to get my user a present that she would like and pack it in a cool way that would represent her characteristics. During my research I found out that she loves food and especially Nutella and is passionate about photography, I got a good sense of what to make for her.

            <h4>Design Vision</h4>
            <p>
              Design direction:<b> A meaningful real-life imitation of gift-giving </b><br />The
              experience we want the user to have should imitate the feeling she has with her loved
              ones, but remotely from wherever she is. We want her to have a surprise moment when
              receiving the present, giving her a sense of recognition from others reaching out to
              her. Maya is a person who loves to keep meaningful gifts in a box/on the wall, so
              there should be a possibility to preserve those significant gifts in a cool way
              online.

            <h4>Ideation</h4>
            <p>
              Before ideation, my partner and I had to combine our user portraits and create a persona that will guide us through the next steps in the design process. We came up with several How Might We questions and used them to conduct testing by using creative techniques like the worst idea, brainwriting, and dot voting. 
Afterward, we had to do braindump ourselves by coming up with 40 ideas and then sketching 20 of them. This followed with paper prototypes, and three draft concepts per team member.

              After ideation, I created a storyboard to visually predict and explore my users' experience with the gift-giving-experience app. To give you a better understanding of design, you can take a look at the video.
