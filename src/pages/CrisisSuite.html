            <p id="introduction">
                For the course Research & Design, every student had an opportunity to choose between six companies and their design challenges. I chose Merlin Software B.V as my client and their main goal is to help organizations limit the damage in a crisis, by supporting them with practical software tools for crisis management.

          <h4 class="prso">Design challenge: </h4>
          <p>
            The design challenge was to improve the CrisisSuite software in the warm phase.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="wrapper">
          <h4 class="prso">Goal: </h4>
          <p>
            My main goal with this challenge is to improve the most used and critical tool during a crisis – Logtool. The user can register all the necessary information there which is crucial in a crisis.</p>

            <h4>Empathize phase</h4>
            <p>
                In the define phase, I got to know the client and their product through interviews, desk research, expert review, and competitor analysis. This helped me figure out what feature of the app I want to work on.  My first phase of research identified the following pain points related to a feature called Logtool.            </p>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>In the Logtool there is no way to edit, delete, add attachments, or complete the action in the mobile
                    version, as it is possible in the desktop version.</li>
                    <li>Everything should be consistent throughout the app, but in Logtool there has been made an exception
                        with adding information. Instead of a “+” button, there is a text box.</li>     
            <li>In the Logtool the icons and their names (perception, assessment, action, decision) seem unclear. I
                would like to find out if the icons and descriptions are understandable for the user.</li> 
            </ol>

            <h4>Insights</h4>
            <p>
            By the end of this phase I gathered three high-level insights about the Logtool:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>It is important to have the same functions as in the desktop version to provide users consistency throughout the software.
                </li>
                <li>The Logtool is missing an easy way for the user to recall actions.
                </li>
                <li>The current user flow is not familiar to the user. Their expectations of certain functions are not applied to the software.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Step 3 Redesign</h4>
            <p>
              The redesign of the grocery store website began with a style tile and the creation of initial wireframes.
