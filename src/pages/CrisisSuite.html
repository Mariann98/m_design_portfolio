                For the course Research & Design, every student had an opportunity to choose between six companies and their design challenges. I chose Merlin Software B.V as my client and their main goal is to help organizations limit the damage in a crisis, by supporting them with practical software tools for crisis management.

          <h4 class="prso">Design challenge: </h4>
          <p>
            The design challenge was to improve the CrisisSuite software in the warm phase.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="wrapper">
          <h4 class="prso">Goal: </h4>
          <p>
            My main goal with this challenge is to improve the most used and critical tool during a crisis – Logtool. The user can register all the necessary information there which is crucial in a crisis.</p>

            <h4>Empathize phase</h4>
            <p>
                In the define phase, I got to know the client and their product through interviews, desk research, expert review, and competitor analysis. This helped me figure out what feature of the app I want to work on.  My first phase of research identified the following pain points related to a feature called Logtool.            </p>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>In the Logtool there is no way to edit, delete, add attachments, or complete the action in the mobile
                    version, as it is possible in the desktop version.</li>
                    <li>Everything should be consistent throughout the app, but in Logtool there has been made an exception
                        with adding information. Instead of a “+” button, there is a text box.</li>     
            <li>In the Logtool the icons and their names (perception, assessment, action, decision) seem unclear. I
                would like to find out if the icons and descriptions are understandable for the user.</li> 
            </ol>

            <h4>Insights</h4>
            <p>
            By the end of this phase I gathered three high-level insights about the Logtool:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>It is important to have the same functions as in the desktop version to provide users consistency throughout the software.
                </li>
                <li>The Logtool is missing an easy way for the user to recall actions.
                </li>
                <li>The current user flow is not familiar to the user. Their expectations of certain functions are not applied to the software.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p>Out of my insights, I made two visual conclusions - an empathy map and a storyboard.</p>

            <h4>Design vision</h4>
            <p>
                <b>Clear and intuitive Logtool</b><br>
                The design direction for the CrisisSuite software is to redesign the Logtool to make it more comprehensible for
                the users. It should make them feel like every action taken comes naturally without the need to rethink their
                choices. For the user to have an effortless and intuitive experience with the app, the focus needs to be on
                efficiency, retainability, and flow. This means the product will be consistent and predictable. <br>Additionally,
                according to the client's needs, the new design should make the users feel like they are using an authentic and
                visually pleasing application that fills their every need when it comes to logging information.

            <h4>Ideate phase</h4>
            <p>
            The ideation process started with pointing out the main pain points from my key insights and coming up with How Might We questions. I used the method called Mindmapping to come up with a lot of different ideas and solutions. <br> After diverging, I started visualizing my ideas in XD. These sketches guided me through the iteration when I tested my ideas with participants. I sketched different versions of how the user might predict the button locations to be or actions that might take place.

              <h4>Prototyping phase</h4>
              <p>
                As a next step, I did iteration with three participants and gained valuable insights from them which helped me create the final concept board and start with low-fidelity prototyping. Here you can see a few of them.</p>            </div>
