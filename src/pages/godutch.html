              During this project for 'Interaction Design 2' course, my team of 2 learned user interaction design techniques to
              create the (information) structure of an interactive digital product.

          <h4 class="prso">Problem: </h4>
          <p>
            The website is lacking structure and emotion. Information is cluttered creating a lot of visual noise and distraction for the user. It also does not give a visual and conceptual feeling of a Dutch store, which avoids the user creating emotional engagement with the store. 
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="wrapper">
          <h4 class="prso">Solution: </h4>
          <p>
            Making the website effective and structured by creating a look that is visually pleasing and clutter-free. The new design will be more engaging to the users which makes them want to come back to the site and order more of their favorite foods from their culture. The redesign should give the users feedback on their actions and be user-friendly without overwhelming the user.

            <h4>Step 3 Redesign</h4>
            <p>
              The redesign of the grocery store website began with a style tile and the creation of initial wireframes.
